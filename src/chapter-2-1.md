Definition of AI-Powered Storytelling
-------------------------------------

AI-powered storytelling refers to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to create, curate, and personalize stories and narratives for individual users or entire audiences. These technologies can analyze vast amounts of data on user behavior, preferences, and interactions with content to generate insights that inform the creation of compelling, personalized stories and narratives.

AI-powered storytelling can take many forms, including:

* Personalized content recommendations based on user behavior
* Interactive chatbots or virtual assistants that engage with users in natural language
* Customized news articles generated based on reader preferences
* Audio-based stories and narratives created using speech recognition and generation technologies
* Visual content, such as images and videos, analyzed and interpreted using computer vision algorithms to create more engaging and personalized visual content.
