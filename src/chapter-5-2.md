Organizations must take steps to ensure the security and privacy of user data. This includes implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Data should be stored securely and deleted when no longer needed.

Regularly Review and Update Data

Data used for storytelling should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure its relevance and accuracy. This includes identifying and addressing potential biases, updating data sources as necessary, and ensuring that the data is up-to-date and reflects current trends and behaviors.
